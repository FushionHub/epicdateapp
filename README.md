## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is divided into three main parts:
- `client/`: The main React-based user-facing application.
- `admin/`: A separate React-based dashboard for administrators.
- `supabase/`: The backend, including database schema and serverless Edge Functions.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm
- Supabase CLI

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set Up Third-Party Services:**
    You will need to create accounts and projects for:
    - **Supabase:** For the database, backend functions, and storage.
    - **Firebase:** For authentication and push notifications.
    - **Paystack:** For payment processing.

3.  **Configure the Database:**
    - In your Supabase project, navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
    - Copy the entire contents of the `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` file.
    - Paste the SQL into a new query and click **Run**.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Both the `client` and `admin` applications rely on a `.env` file at their respective roots for configuration. You will need to create `.env` files in both `client/` and `admin/` and add the necessary Firebase and Supabase API keys. Refer to `client/src/firebaseConfig.js` and `client/src/supabaseClient.js` to see which environment variables are required.
    - In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Functions** and add the required secrets (e.g., `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) for the Edge Functions.

5.  **Install Dependencies & Run:**
    To run the main client application:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

    To run the admin panel:
    ```bash
    cd admin
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The admin panel will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (or the next available port).
